## Abstract

Peer-to-peer electronic cash would allow online payments from one party to another without going through a financial institution.  
Proposed solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power.

## 1. Introduction

Commerce on the internet relies on financial institutions to process electronic payments, this system suffers from the inherent weakness of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not possible, because of this the need for trust spreads. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.  
These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.  
--> What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted third party... The author proposes a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions. The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes, *They will generate the longest chain and outpace attackers!!

## 2. Transactions

Satoshi defines an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership.

The problem is that the payee can't verify, in a decentralised way, that one of the owners did not double-spend the coin...  
For Bitcoin's purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, the network doesn't care about later attempts to double-spend. The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to be aware of all transactions.  

**--> For the Bitcoin network to decide which transaction arrived first, it needs to be aware of all transactions. Transactions must be announced publicly, and a system is needed where participants agree on a single history of the order in which the transactions were received.**
**The payee needs proof that at the time of each transaction, the majority of nodes agreed it was the first received!!**

## 3. Timestamp Server

The solution Satoshi proposes begins with a timestamp server.  
A timestamp server works by taking a hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash. The timestamp proves that the data must have existed at the time, in order to get into the hash. Each timestamp includes the previous timestamp in its hash, forming a chain, with each additional timestamp reinforcing the ones before it.

## 4. Proof-of-Work (POW)

To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, Bitcoin will need to use a proof-of-work system. This involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits. The average work required is exponential in the number of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash. For the timestamp network, the proof-of-work is implemented by incrementing a nonce in the block until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits.  
**-->The goal is to find a nonce that produces a hash starting with a predetermined number of zeros. When a miner finds a valid nonce, they have "solved" the block and get to broadcast their block to the Bitcoin network.**  
Once the CPU effort has been expended to make it satisfy the proof-of-work, the block cannot be changed without redoing the work. As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block would include redoing all the blocks after it.

![Proof-of-Work](images/bitcoin-proof-of-work.png)

The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision making. POW is essentially one-CPU-one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest POW effort invested in it. If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains...  
To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, the POW difficulty is determined by a moving average targetting an average number of blocks per hour, preventing inflation or rapid chain growth. Approximately 1 block is created every 10 minutes, if they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases. This target (a 256-bit integer) is adjusted every **2016 blocks**, which is designed to occur approximately every two weeks (2016 x 10 minutes = 20,160 minutes â‰ˆ 14 days).

## 5. Network

The steps to run the network are as follows:

  1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.
  2) Each node collects new transactions into a block.
  3) Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.
  4) When a node finds a POW, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.
  5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.
  6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain,using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.

Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on extending it. If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some nodes may receive one or the other first. In that case , they work on the first one they received, but save the other branch in case it becomes longer. The tie will be broken when the next POW is found and one branch becomes longer; the nodes that were working on the other branch will then switch to the longer one. If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and realizes it missed one.

## 6. Incentive

By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them. The steady addition of a constant amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending resources to add gold to circulation. In the case of Bitcoin this is CPU time and electricity that is expended.  
The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees. If the output value of a transaction is less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of the block containing the transaction. Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free!!  

## 7. Reclaiming Disk Space

Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash, transactions are hashed in a Merkle tree, with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do not need to be stored.

## 8. Simplified Payment Verification

It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node. A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest POW chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.

![Simplified Payment Verification](images/bitcoin-simplified-payment-verification.png)

As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent  security and quicker verification.

## 9. Combining and Splitting Value

Although it would be possible to handle coins individually, it would be unwieldy to make a separate transaction for every cent in a transfer. To allow value to be split and combined, transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs. Normally there will be either a single input from a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two outputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender.

![Combining and Splitting Value](images/bitcoin-combining-and-splitting-value.png)

It should be noted that fan-out, where a transaction depends on several transactions, and those transactions depend on many more, is not a problem here. There is never the need to extract a complete standalone copy of a transaction's history.

## 10. Privacy

The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting acces to information to the parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly  preludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of individual trades, the "tape", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.

![Privacy](images/bitcoin-privacy.png)

As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner.
Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to the same owner.

## 11. Calculations

The scenario is concidered where an attacker tries to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent.  
--> The race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial Random Walk.  
--> The probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler's Ruin problem.

Gambler's Ruin problem Calculation:

p= probability an honest node finds the next block  
q= probability the attacker finds the next block  
qz= probability the attacker will ever catch up from z blocks behind  

![Calculations](images/bitcoin-calculations.png)

p+q=1 (Total Hash Power off the Bitcoin Blockchain)  
Given the assumption that p>q, the probability drops exponentially as the number of blocks the attacker has to catch up with increases.  
(My interpretation is that pâ‰ˆthe hash power controlled by honest nodes and that qâ‰ˆhash power controlled by the attacker...)  
It now is concidered how long the recipient of a new transaction needs to wait before being sufficiently certain the sender can't change the transaction...(z=amount of blocks created on the Bitcoin blockchain since the honest senders transaction was included).  

-->The math proves Bitcoin's security grows exponentially with z (confirmations).  
-->For a weak attacker (low q), even 6 confirmations make succes probability tiny (â‰ˆ0.0002%).
-->The higher the attackers hash power (q), the more the probability of succes will become. If q approaches 0.5, the network is vulnarable, that's why q>50% hash power is a "51% attack"!!  

It is common to wait for 6 comfirmations (â‰ˆ1 hour) to be pretty certain that a transaction has been  finalised and is irreversable...
